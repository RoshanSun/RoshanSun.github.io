    First, this is a paragraph with no spaces. <br/>
    And a second line in here. <br/>
    <br/>
    It happens with                 too       many       spaces <br/>


    I want more than one space between this | &nbsp; | <br/>

    Yo I'm the best. Here, keep going: <a href="page6.html"> right here </a>
